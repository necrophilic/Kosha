Alright, so. let me explain a couple of things about the following bots/clients.
the following file "testing_client.c" has the following methods and is the most updated. 
["STD", "KOSHA", "UDP", "CRUSH", "STOMP"]


client_IPHM.c was made for implementing methods that work over IP Header Modifications / Modified network using IP Spoofing.
these methods require the scanners except for raw_udp, this will make it easier for the users to send attacks WITHOUT killing the devices
instead of simply using the devices scanned to this source, it will use reflection files and or server bandwidth to send the attack.
Very useful! > we are using devices to take down IPBlocks & Companies < We are using Amplifications / SBA to take down home connections and crush our enemies!


I ask that you do not edit these files and or take credit for creating them, if you are to edit these, give credits to the developer
